# Intern Projects - 2015

This year the Next Jump interns were divided into three teams to spend 30% of their time developing a project that aligns with our Adopt-a-School initiative. Their task was to develop a project that addresses common problems across public schools. Below are the projects that they came up with.

## Shoot for the Stars 
###Priya, Lily, Liang, Abhay
"Shoot for the Stars" is a performance recognition/rewarding system to encourage students who do well not just in academics, but also in a variety of other activities ranging from sports, arts, public speaking, talent, through positive reinforcement. The students are rewarded stars through this system. These stars can then be redeemed by the student in a “Star Shop” online, where a student can "buy" things like 15 minutes longer recess, 1 day extension on HW, permission to wear superman cape (in the school) for a day, stickers, books, tickets to movies, candies, etc.

## After3 
### Michelle, Andrea, Yang, Michael
After3 is a web-based application that will allow students to explore extracurricular interests and provide the platform for organizing afterschool activities. Think: Reddit crowdsourcing + event planner. Students will be able to suggest activities that can be liked by both students and teachers, and these activities can be organized by most liked, by category (arts, sports, etc.), and more. Teachers and even students or parents can then “own”/sponsor one of these events, meaning they are committing to organizing the event.

## Computers for Kids 
### Zachary, Justin, Harsh, Brandon
Computers for Kids seeks to introduce and excite young students about the wide realm of computing through an interactive yet informative web application. Focusing on the most basic elements of computing, this hands on application will give students a basic understanding of how a computer works, as well as interest them in the potential careers and opportunities that this technology can offer. This program will provide all students from any school system with the opportunity to learn about a technology that has become one of the most important sectors in the professional world.
